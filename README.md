# Data Analysis - User Engagement

## **Overview**

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of user data from a betting website, focusing on the UEFA EURO 2024 and CONMEBOL Copa Am√©rica USA 2024 events. The dataset spans all 11 rounds of the events, including detailed categorization and metadata of the players. Our goal was to extract valuable insights to study user engagement, enhance it, and propose actionable recommendations for the company to improve future events.

## Repository Structure

-   **`data_analysis.R`**: This file contains all the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

-   **`SQL/`**: This directory contains the SQL queries used to construct a small database with the provided data, as well as some queries to describe the contained data. Although building this database wasn't strictly necessary, I believed it could be useful for future work. Additionally, it allowed me to demonstrate proficiency with another technology beyond R.

-   **`plots/`**: This directory holds the data visualizations generated with R.
