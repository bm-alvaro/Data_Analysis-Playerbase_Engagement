# Ludicrum Technical Task - Data Analyst

## **Overview**

This project involves analyzing data from the "Sport Predictor" feature at GemBet.

## Repository Structure

-   **`data_analysis.R`**: This file contains all the code for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

-   **`SQL/`**: This directory contains the SQL queries used to construct a small database with the provided data, as well as some queries to describe the contained data. Although building this database wasn't strictly necessary, I believed it could be useful for future work. Additionally, it allowed me to demonstrate proficiency with another technology beyond R.

-   **`plots/`**: This directory holds the data visualizations generated with R.

-   **`survey_analysis.R`**: This script was intended to analyze data from the Survey PDF file. However, due to time constraints, this analysis has not yet been completed.
